        <h1>What You Need</h1>
        <p>You only need your imagination and a set of dice.</p> <br>
        <p>Dungeons and Dragons (D&D or DnD) is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) that has been around since the 1970's. It was a fairly niche game, but became popularized in recent years by media such as the Netflix Show <em>Stranger Things</em> and the Web-show <em>Critical Role</em>. Both bringing Dungeons and Dragons to more popular media and the mainstream part of the internet. </p> <br>

        <h1>Materials</h1>
        <p>Although it is technically possible to play DnD without dice, most Dungeon Masters and Players use them. Dice help to randomize events to help your story unfold in a more natural way that allows everyone to be a hero, and makes everyone overcome adversity from time to time.</p><br>

        <p>You will need the rules of the game. You can find everything from how to create a character to a list of possible items and their values in the Players Handbook. For aspiring Dungeon Masters, the Dungeon Masters Guide is a must-have. You can start playing with only those two books, but you may want to branch out into other books that have more monsters, races, classes, lands, and encounters. A great online resource for this type of thing is DnD Beyond. There, you can create a character for free and access limited content from the Players Handbook.</p><br><br>

        <p>If you want to see where your characters are in relation to the monsters they are fighting, you may want to invest in some miniatures.</p><br>
